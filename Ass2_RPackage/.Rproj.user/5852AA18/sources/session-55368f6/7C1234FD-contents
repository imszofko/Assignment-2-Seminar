The statanalysis package is the result of an assignment for the class 'Methods and Tools for Software Development in Bioinformatics'
}
\details{
The following package will input an RNA-seq count data and sample data into R.
First the function performs filtering to remove low-expressed genes.
After filtering statistical analysis is performed using DESeq2 package and other statistical anaylsis methods
After DEGs are identified over representation analysis is done.
enrichGO and enrichKEGG functions are used from the clusterProfile package
When all is said and done, a table with the DEGs data is exported to Excel format and plots are created to visualize the results of the enrichment analysis.
